discrete-representation
=========

 [**KeLP**][kelp-site] is the Kernel-based Learning Platform developed in the [Semantic Analytics Group][sag-site] of
the [University of Roma Tor Vergata][uniroma2-site]. 

This is the discrete-representation module of KeLP. It contains the representation such as sequence, string or trees.

In particular _TreeRepresentation_ models a tree structure that can be employed for representing syntactic trees or DNA sequences. It is exploited by tree kernels in kernel-based methods.

_SequenceRepresentation_ models a sequence structure that can be employed for representing for instance sequences of words. It is exploited by sequence kernels in kernel-based methods.

_StringRepresentation_ models a string and it is useful for storing plain text. For instance it can include  comments to be attached to an example.
